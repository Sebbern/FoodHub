To run the .net version of the project unzip the subapplication1 zip-file containing FoodHub and FoodhubTests, you must open the “FoodHub” folder in your IDE, then write “dotnet build FoodHub.csproj” in your IDE’s terminal. After the project is built, you must then write “dotnet run” to run the project and obtain a localhost ip/port. Copy/paste the same localhost ip/port (default is localhost:3000) in your web browser to successfully access the project’s web application. To run the MVC tests, use cd to move to the FoodHub.Tests folder, then write “dotnet test” to run the tests.

After booting, the web application enables users to explore and search for food items, with options to categorize and sort the results. While browsing is open to all, registered users gain access to full CRUD operations on items. Registration requires a valid email and a secure password meeting specified criteria (one small letter, one big letter, one number, one special character, and minimum six characters). Once registered, users can manage food items via a dedicated menu accessible from the navigation bar when logged in.

To run the React version of the project, you must first unzip the subapplication2 zip-file, then open the FoodHubReact/foodhub folder in your IDE. Then you must install the required packages by executing the command: “npm install” in the terminal. After installation you can then run the backend by initializing the debugging tool by clicking F5 (on Windows, FN+F5 on Mac). Keep in mind that your IDE’s workspace folder MUST be in the folder above “FoodHubReact” for this to work. Afterwards you can start the web application by executing the command: “npm start” in the terminal. Usage of the site works the same way as in subapplication 1. However, the CRUD operations are freely available to all users on this subapplication, where they are accessed from the search and detailed view menu.
